      "On each episode of The Prince Mixtape, weâ€™ll meet people who knew Prince, worked with him, or simply loved him from afar. Host Nichole Perkins will dig deep into key moments of his life, like when his sexually liberated lyrics gave birth to the Parental Advisory Sticker, when he fought to own his masters, and when he rocked that infamous, delicious booty cut-out pantsuit. The first season of this series explored the unforgettable life of Princess Diana. On season two, just like a treasured mixtape from your favorite crush, the series is a reflection of all the care and passion, the big moments and small, that made up a life. Prince's life.",
